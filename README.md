\# 100 Days of Python 🐍



This is my personal coding journey through the #100DaysOfPython challenge.  

Each day I’ll commit new code, notes, or mini-projects as I learn and grow.



💻 Topics covered:

\- Variables, input/output

\- Functions, conditionals, loops

\- Small projects (calculators, games, etc.)
